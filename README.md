# My personal website v3

> Active development is in progress

This is my third iteration of personal website. Under the hood I use [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and [Contentful](https://contenful.com) for API based Content Management System. 

[Here is a link](https://elastic-bhabha-78ee1e.netlify.com/) to preview site on netlify.

## Motivation

I started to realize that I want to write and teach some stuff that I know. So I managed to start (tech) blogging and started writing on [Medium](https://medium.com/@aibolkussain) and [dev.to](https://dev.to/aibolik). Then I realized that I also have [my own website](https://aibolik.github.io), hosted on GitHub Pages. At front that was just a Jekyll theme and my markdown content. Since I am a FrontEnd/JavaScript(I actually like considering myself as a full stack ðŸ˜€) developer, I must create website on my own and it should coinside with my stack. Therefore I've chosen a stack listed before and managed eventually to do it.

## Installing

Run `yarn install` to install all dependencies.

### Initial Configuration

Currently there is no configuration, but more to come.

## Developing

In order to start developing and run it on localhost run `yarn develop`(after all dependencies have installed). Then you can go to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to see the project. Addtionally [localhost:8000/___graphql](http://localhost:8000/___graphql) is available from where you can make *GraphQL* queries.

### Building

If you run `yarn build` you will get optimized build in `public/` folder.

### Deploying / Publishing

The project is deployed freely on Netlify [here](https://elastic-bhabha-78ee1e.netlify.com/).
