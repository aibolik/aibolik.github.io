# My personal website v3

This is my third iteration of personal website. Under the hood I use [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and [Contentful](https://contenful.com) for API based Content Management System. 

## Motivation

I started to realize that I want to write and teach some stuff that I know. So I managed to start (tech) blogging and started writing on [Medium](https://medium.com/@aibolkussain) and [dev.to](https://dev.to/aibolik). Then I realized that I also have [my own website](https://aibolik.github.io), hosted on GitHub Pages. At front that was just a Jekyll theme and my markdown content. Since I am a FrontEnd/JavaScript(I actually like considering myself more full stack ðŸ˜€) developer, I must create website on my own and it should coinside with my stack. Therefore I've chosen a stack listed before and managed eventually to do it.
