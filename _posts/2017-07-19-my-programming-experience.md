title:	My Programming Experience
---

Hi, there! I will begin with explaining how I started my way in programming.
 
_In the far 2008th_, I entered to Kazakh-Turkish High School for gifted students. All Kazakh-Turkish Schools in our country make a big emphasis on subject Olympiads. Our school was not an exception. In the first quarter, after 2-3 weeks of study, you write a test and choose 3 subjects that you want to study deeply, to go to Olympiad. My first priority subject was **English**. I really liked it. And I had good results than my classmates on lessons. But there was too many students in that subject, so I became a Olympiad student of **Informatics** - my second priority. That is how I began IT geek.
  
I started learning _C++_ very deeply, and all algorithms, graphs, trees and etc. Sometimes, I even won some awards in regional and republic Olympiads. But after 3 years, it started to annoy me, because I learned ACM programming, but could not see the application of it in real life. In 10th grade I downloaded **PHP and MySQL course** from Evgenyi Popov. That was my first steps in Web-programming. I built some simple websites in the end of this course.

_In 2013_, I entered Suleyman Demirel University, to Engineering Faculty, Information Systems department. The lessons were easy, because I already had 5 years of experience in programming, while most of my groupmates had no experience in programming. I entered IT-club - local club in University for those who interested in IT. There was many sections like, Web, iOS, Android, Game Dev. I liked Android, so I went to that section. 

I went to **Android Development**. That was not so hard. Having experience in programming helped me with that. So learning curve had a steep growth in the beginning for me. 

_After a year_, I started taking projects for freelance. They were small projects but helped me gaining experience in Android Development. [Android Developers Site][android]{:target="_blank"} was my favorite site. Mostly I was self-taught developer, and never know how to write perfect code. I read blogs of Android Developers to gain more experience and learn to write perfect code. These blogs are [Fernando Cejas][fernando] (lead engineer at SoundCloud), [Romain Guy][romain] (Software Engineer at Google), [Hannes Dorfmann][hanness] (Software Engineer, Open Source contributor, after of MVP Mosby framework), [Dmitro Danylyk][dmitro] (Google Developer Expert) and others.

_Along with this_, I did not end up with Web development. It was always interesting for me, so I also was interested in this sphere. In university I took course where I got to know with **ReactJS** and other _JavaScript_ libraries. Then I worked as _Web Developer_ in "SOFT IT" LLC, where I furthered my knowledge in Web development.

_In 2016_, one company invited me to position of Android Developer. The company was [Mars Studio][marsstudio] - they develop mobile applications, mostly for other Businesses(B2B). After a month, I was promoted to Lead Android Developer. I had more responsibility and I liked it. But those days I really wanted to be free, and start own business, **become an entrepreneur**. I quit a job, after I finished last application and started building own business. 
 
 I had my ups and downs and now I almost lost everything. Entrepreneur inside me did not let me go to work, and work for someone. Now I start to understand that I want to be an expert in one field. I am young and everything is ahead. But now, I do not want to stay in one place. I want to move forward, so _Freelancing_ is like freedom for me where I can get more experience in interesting field. I chose to work for foreign companies, where I can make a real value for company and for customers of company. My selection was **TopTal** because I strongly believe I am talented developer, who deserves to be among top talents. That is the reason I want to join to [Toptal React.js Engineering Community][toptalapp].
   
 _Anyway_, I have just applied for TopTal, and tomorrow I am having an online meeting. I really like to get in and become one of top developers who work there.
 
 Thank you for reading!
