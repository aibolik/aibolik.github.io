title:	Udacity Android course. Recap

How's it going?

I was going to write this post last _two months_, but today is the day I have time and intention to write this post.

About two months ago, when I was on my winter holidays, I passed a course on **[Udacity][udacity]{:target="_blank"}**, called _**Developing Android Apps**_ built by **Google**. The couse level is _intermediate_, and time needed to pass is ten weeks, assuming 6 hours per week. But I finished it in about 10 days.

Here in this post, I want to _conclude_ what I have done and learned throughout this course. Actually, I was writing what I have learned in each big commit, in my [GitHub repo for this course][githubrepo]{:target="_blank"}.

By the end of the course, we had a built application called **Sunshine**, that uses _Android's best practices_.

Why to choose **Sunshine?** Because it has all functionality that more advanced application has, and we can see in practice many APIs, where and how they are used.

So, what I have learned new for me:

1. Implementing _Settings(Preferences) Activity_ **without imlpementing any UI**
2. Using Fragments in **two pane mode**
3. _The most important thing I learned, Android Best Practice for **Database Implementation**(Using Contract-DbHelper- Provider scheme)_
4. And the _second most important thing - **Using Services**_
5. Also some small tricky things I did not know...

The more about each _my learning_ you can learn [here][gitcommits]{:target="_blank"}, by reading each commit message and browsing [repo.][githubrepo]{:target="_blank"}
