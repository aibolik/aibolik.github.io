Hi, there!

About a month ago, one man came to our University and started handling one course called [**"Moneymaking"**][moneymaking]{:target="_blank"}(thanks to our Head of [Information Systems Department][is]{:target="_blank"} - _Mr. Meirambek Zhaparov_).

This man really knows how to _make money_, and he is teaching us about it. Thanks to this course I launched my courses on Android development. If someone is interested, [visit my instagram page][kursy_android]{:target="_blank"}.

We call ourselves **"Moneymakers"**, and it is really _breathtaking_. Throughout this course I understood many things, and also it changed my mind, my views to some things.

In this post, I will be doing my homework on this course. The homework was to find **_20 channels, from where we can get traffic_**(he said their actual number is more than 200).
