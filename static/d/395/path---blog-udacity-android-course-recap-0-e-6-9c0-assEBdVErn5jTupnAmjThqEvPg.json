Because it has all functionality that more advanced application has, and we can see in practice many APIs, where and how they are used.</p>\n<p>So, what I have learned new for me:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Implementing <em>Settings(Preferences) Activity</em> without imlpementing any UI</li>\n<li>Using Fragments in two pane mode</li>\n<li><em>The most important thing I learned, Android Best Practice for Database Implementation(Using Contract-DbHelper- Provider scheme)</em></li>\n<li>And the <em>second most important thing - Using Services</em></li>\n<li>Also some small tricky things I did not know…</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The more about each <em>my learning</em> you can learn <a href=\"https://github.com/aibolik/Sunshine/commits/master\">here</a>, by reading each commit message and browsing <a href=\"https://github.com/aibolik/Sunshine\">repo</a>.</p>"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"udacity-android-course-recap"}}
