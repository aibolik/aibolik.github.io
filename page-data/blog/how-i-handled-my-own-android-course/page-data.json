The <em>purpose</em> of that course is to <em>start a business from zero</em>. Our mentor said us to choose a niche.

I also had some competitor, who was handling <em>Web and iOS Courses</em>, but we did not intersect too much.</p>\n<p><em>Then</em>, I started promoting my course: created account on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kursy_android/\">instagram</a>, made an advertisement on University's bulletin board.

I said \"Okay, anyway, it is hypothesis test\", and started my course. On 3rd day of the course, 5 more students joined, but 2 of them left. And I had <em>6 students</em> at that time.</p>\n<p>I took the course design from <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com\">Udacity's</a> course - <em><strong>Developing Android Apps.</strong></em> And here is the <strong>Mistake #1</strong> - the course was a bit hard for beginners, I tried to modify it, take off some topics, so that it would fit their level. The level of this course is <em>Intermediate</em>, I should take for <em>Beginners</em>. <strong>Mistake #2</strong> was that I did not write <em>Prerequisites</em>.</p>\n<p>Anyway, last day of the course I made a longer lesson, I finished course, made some conclusions, gave some directions to the future, made consultation about their projects. Although I had <em>some mistakes</em> carrying course, in my opinion, I could <strong>give value to my students</strong> for the offered price.</p>\n<p>I created Google Form, so that they could give some <em>feedback</em>. That form says they liked course and they have something to learn from course, and the price is quite good. Besides, I was writing <em>notes</em> and kinda analyzing everything.</p>\n<p>By the end, I felt satisfied. I am thinking about changing course format and other things. Even if I liked what I did, it is not okay for me to spend two hours a day. If took look from <strong><em>Moneymaker's prospective</em></strong>, it is not very good business. I mean, the way I did. It should have <strong>scalability</strong>. Actually, it does. But this plan shifts for some time, because I have other <em>projects and work</em> to do.</p>"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"how-i-handled-my-own-android-course"}}}
